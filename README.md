Android developer nanodegree, Projects 1 &amp; 2: Popular Movies app
# About Popular Movies
It is a fully functional and colorful android app which I made from scratch for Android Developer Nanodegree program. This app reveals the power of adaptive UI both for phone and tablet devices.
With the app, you can:

1)Discover the most popular, the most rated or the highest rated movies
2)Save favorite movies locally to view them even when offline
3)Watch trailers
4)Read reviews

# How to Work with the Source
This app uses The Movie Database API to retrieve movies. You must provide your own API key in order to build the app.
Find the variable named API_KEY in the file and paste your key:-
